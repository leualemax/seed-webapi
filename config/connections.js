/**
 * Connections API Configuration
 *
 * Connections are like "saved settings" for your adapters.
 * Each model must have a `connection` property (a string) which is references the name of one
 * of these connections.  If it doesn't, the default `connection` configured in `config/models.js`
 * will be applied.  Of course, a connection can (and usually is) shared by multiple models.
 *
 * NOTE: If you're using version control, you should put your passwords/api keys
 * in `config/local.js`, environment variables, or use another strategy.
